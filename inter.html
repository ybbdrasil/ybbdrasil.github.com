					Hi. My name is Bobby Fabie. I am 35 yrs old and I currently live in mabalacat pampanga. But I'll be moving back to Manila in January or February.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a graduate of a 2-year Associate Course in Computer System Design and Programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					After graduation, I got into some networking companies and some bogus company.
				</p>
		My first actual job was at ePerformax Makati as a Directory Assistant in 2011. 
				<p>
		I left after a year. I took some rest and also got back to the computer shop of my uncle as a shop attendant.
				</p>
				<p>
		In 2014, I got hired at SUTHERLAND in Cubao. I worked as a TSR providing support for computer issues, setup, and optimization,s
				</p>
				<p>
		I resigned from the job because I tried a sort of freelancing job as a website designer and I created some really small websites for friends of friends and some college students as well.
				</p>
				<p>
		Then in 2015 I got in at REIMAGE PH in Makati as a Tier 2 TSR. We provided support for any Windows related issues, printer and networking issues and other  technical issues. We provided support via phone, email, chat, and remote sessions. They also trained us for an IT Helpdesk Role because they almost had a client for that but they did not push through for some reasons. After 2 years there, I got promoted as a Resolution Specialist. It is the same as a Subject Matter Expert. I was doing the daily and weekly performance reports of the team and also handling escalated tickets from the team including remote session assistance.
				</p>
				<p>

		In 2019, I resigned and I tried freelancing again. That time as a Social Media Specialist. I basically manage the social media accounts of some small businesses, I did their daily content posting and follower engagement.
				</p>
				<p>

		After that, I got an offer from Topdata in Pampanga as a non voice technical support representative. The client was a VPN service provider so as a TSR, I assisted customers in setting up and troubleshooting their VPN. We also did internal testing of the VPN software before it's released to the public. That's also when the pandemic started. We were working in the office almost the whole pandemic time.
				</p>
				<p>

		I worked there until August of last year. I resigned because of the inconvenience issues regarding my health. I had a chronic allergic rhinitis where I experienced a runny nose, I sneezed a lot and had reddy eyes for most of the shift like everyday so it became an inconvenience to me and to the others around me. it was not really contagious, but because it was a time of pandemic they had to require me to get a clearance from my doctor. And I had to do the clearance, for like 2 or 3 times a month just to make sure and that became really tireful for me so I decided to rest for some time.

				<h3 class="questions-h2">
					What is my greatest Strength?
				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					I am passionate about technology and computers. I love learning new things and I learn things pretty quickly. And for me this is more not just you average daily work but this is also something that I actually enjoy doing.

				</p>
				<p>
I am very patient. I am probably the most patient person that I know. I like to listen to people to understand them and learn why they do what they do. I believe that there is always a reason why someone does something. It doesn’t really matter if it is a simple reason or a complicated reason because it depends on the person’s emotional state at the time.

			<div class="questions-section">
				<h3 class="questions-h2">
					What's your biggest weakness?
				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					My biggest weakness is the fact that I don't yet have much experience in talking to large groups of people. This is something I am very keen to improve on, so if any opportunities were to arise in this position to gain experience in this area, I would certainly want to take advantage of that.
				</p>

			<div class="questions-section">
				<h3 class="questions-h2">
					How would other people describe you?
				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					I belive my previous colleagues would describe me as someone they could turn to whenever they needed assistance or someone they could rely on to help them out at short notice and someone who has a can-do attitude.

				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					I welcome it with open arms. I really like criticisms, especially in matters related to my work. Because no one is perfect and I will know what I need to work  on and that will help me further improve my skills.

				</h3>
				<p class="answers-h2">
					I see myself hopefully working for your company either in the same role or having promoted to a higher level. In 5 years, I would have also developed significantly and be seen as a trusted, reliable and productive member of the company.
